# Sunspot Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting sunspots using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on forecasting solar activity based on historical sunspot data and relevant solar parameters.

## Project Overview

Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. Predicting sunspots is essential for understanding solar dynamics and space weather forecasting. This project employs machine learning algorithms to predict future sunspot activity based on past observations.

## Features

- **Time Series Data Processing:** Techniques for processing time series data of sunspot numbers and solar parameters.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of regression algorithms time series models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and methods for evaluating the performance of sunspot prediction models.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing historical sunspot data and forecasted trends.
